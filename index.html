            I enjoy playing the Piano, I have played it ever since I was 6 years old. At first I was not really passionate about it but now  with a lot more practice I have learned to love playing. I have a piano at home which I play almost everyday. I have piano lessons twice a week and enjoy both of them. I have learnt dozens of songs that I love to play but my  favourite one that I am currently learning is called can't help falling in love. Playing the piano is something I have done for a long time and will continue for a long time too. This is why playing the Piano is my favourite hobby.
